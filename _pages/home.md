## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to support the workers at nonprofit organizations and religious organizations responsible for the day-to-day maintenance community-serving buildings around Baltimore City. We seek to collaborate with the workers and organizations responsibility for these buildings to build a new network of mutual support and create open educational resources to support the continued and improved stewardship of "civic spaces".

### Funding

Funding for this project is still under development. Baltimore Heritage is currently applying for grant support.
